# Ikea
Application exploring ARKit using the Ikea App as an example. First commit = The user can pan around his environment and place different objects in
the room. The objects are cup, boxing, vase and a table. 
Lessons learnt -  Setting up ARKit environment, setting up a collection view with labels where the user can select which items he
wants to place in his AR environment. Adding UITapGesturesRecognizers for the user. Setting up ARHitTestResults(), worldTransform()
and setting an Array for the objects. Also importing scenes into the project for the following items, cup, vase, table and boxing ring.
Second commit = The user can delete the items from the AR environment and re-position them somewhere else.
Third commit added more UIGestureRecogniziers, longPress and pinch. Also added the ability for items to be scaled and rotated.
